As you can see above the user has not correctly guessed the flag.

The output results in the user's **score**, **correct flag name** and a **Wikipedia link**.

The script also provides the user buttons to replay the game.

### Leaderboard

As we can see above, the bot can utput the leaderboard for the users within the server.

The username "Team" refers to the team playing mode of the game.
